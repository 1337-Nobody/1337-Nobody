- 👋 Hi, I’m @1337-Nobody
- 👀 I’m interested in vulnerability testing, writing, and illustration. 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning more about Flutter and Python, I can already do logic trees and write basic functions.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anything that needs pentesting more or less but I also like generating writing. 
- 📫 If you would like to reach out please text me at 6062451927...or just send me an email: rhrsurgener@gmail.com, my instagram is rhrsurgener_ I have a lot of cool writing
- and dark art. 
- 😄 Pronouns: They/Them
- ⚡ Fun fact: I can write and draw with both hands.
